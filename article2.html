            <h2>How Your Financial Behaviour Reflects Your Self-Value</h2>
            <p>
                This article delves into the fascinating connection between money and self-worth. 
                We explore how our financial behaviour often mirrors our sense of self-value. Readers will gain insights into how overspending, 
                undersaving, or neglecting financial responsibilities can be indicative of deeper self-esteem issues. 
                We provide actionable strategies for boosting self-worth and improving financial well-being. 
                By recognizing this link, readers can take steps to align their financial habits with their self-value.
